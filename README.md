# Address_Search

This mobile application features a search screen that utilizes the OpenCage Geocoding API for location-based searches. 
The app demonstrates the integration of a third-party API to provide geocoding functionality.

I chose this API primarily because it offers a free tier, making it an accessible option for this test project.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to your company for providing me with the opportunity to work on this test project. The experience has been both challenging and rewarding.
